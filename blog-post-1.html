    <h1 class='blog-posting-title'>My Journey to Becoming a SOC Analyst</h1>
    <p class='blog-posting-content'>This page is dedicated to my own personal pursuit of changing my career at the age of 30. As a father and husband, I want to provide better for my family, and make sure they are taken care of. I know I posess the capability, but it's also a highly-competitive field with lots of other applicants. I've learned the need for certifications, demonstable knowledge and experience. While I do not have a Bachelor's degree, I do have an Associates, a tenacity to learn, to pay attention to details and employ pattern recognition, and the ability to think critically. I am willing to learn on the job, and eager to some day get a role as a SOC analyst.
<br><br>
So far, I have learned a lot. I started this independent studying and career path at the beginning of 2025. I have a tendancy to absorb too much too quickly, so I have been pacing myself. I have learned a lot so far! I have learned about basic SOC fundamentals like which tools are used for what purpose, the Cyber Kill Chain, the MITRE & ATT&CK Framework, Phishing Email Analysis, and Detecting Web Attacks. Each of these was an individual course on my SOC learning path on Let's Defend. And with each course, I have done a write-up, or posting, reflecting what I've learned. <br><br>

<b>1/15/2025</b>: Today I am beginning my next course: "Detecting Web Attacks - 2". It is at this point I decided to develop my own portfolio using what I know from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Upon finishing the basics, I have now established a blog on my page, with the first post being the first lesson of the aformetioned course. That post is now live and covers Open Redirection attacks! <br><br>

I will be posting here with dates next to my updates to document and demonstrate the historical, hard-working, and detailed work ethic that I bring to the table for employers.
